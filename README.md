# kylfusk√∂fu (Icelandic for "club scraper")

## Overview

This application collects random websites from multiple sources and stores them in a SQLite database with intelligent content filtering. The tool focuses on discovering English-language content from the small web and indie blog communities, then syncs the database with IBM Cloud Object Storage and sends notifications via Discord webhook.

## Testing Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Discord webhook URL (for notifications)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greyhoundforty/kylfuskofu
cd kylfuskofu
```

2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=<your-discord-webhook-url>
```

5. Run the application using a local SQLite database

```bash
python app.py --local
```

## Production Setup with Remote Database

To persist data across runs and deployments, configure IBM Cloud Object Storage for database synchronization.

### Prerequisites

- IBM Cloud Object Storage instance with a dedicated bucket

### Environment Variables

```bash
export COS_ENDPOINT=<your-cos-endpoint>
export COS_API_KEY=<your-cos-api-key>
export COS_INSTANCE_CRN=<your-cos-instance-crn>
export COS_BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket-name>
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=<your-discord-webhook-url>
```

### Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

## Development

### Code Quality
The project uses pre-commit hooks for code quality:
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Pylint**: Code analysis and linting
- **Standard hooks**: Trailing whitespace, YAML validation, merge conflict detection

### Install development dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

### Run code quality checks
```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific checks
black .
pylint app.py utils.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No 512KB sites in output**: Sites may not be detected as English. Check logs for detection details.
- **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and virtual environment is activated.
- **Cloud storage errors**: Verify IBM COS credentials and bucket permissions.

### Debugging
Enable detailed logging by checking the Tamga logger output for step-by-step processing information.
