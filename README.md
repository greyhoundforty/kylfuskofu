# kylfusk√∂fu (Icelandic for "club scraper")

A Python tool that collects random websites from 512kb.club and delivers them as a Discord webhook every morning. 

## But why? 

Fair question. I am building this little tool for a few reasons:

- I learn best when I have a problem to solve and I am trying to learn more python in 2025. Two birds, one stone. 
- I love the concept of https://512kb.club/ but visiting the site and clicking the `Visit Random Site` button 20-30 times a day is annoying
- While not all sites are going to be up my alley or even in my native language, I want a way to discover more people and information outside of the traditional social media sites
- I want more data coming into my RSS reader and I am looking for ways to aggregate content and provide myself with more tailored feeds
